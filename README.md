# CatContModel
This is a handbook and R codes for how to conduct data analysis developed by Xin Ye and Kyle Hardman. The original CatContModel is developed by Hardman, Vergauwe, and Ricker (2017). 

This handbook includes instructions for analyzing [1,180] orientation data and how to choose models for your dataset. The models were used to analyze color delayed estimation tasks, but are applicable to more than just color stimuli. These models are difficult to implement and difficult to use. This package simplifies the process of using the models. The original github (https://github.com/hardmanko/CatContModel) has provided main code and R package which can't be used to analysis [1,180] orientation data.
